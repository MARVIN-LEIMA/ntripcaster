This is a mirror of BKG Ntrip Caster V1, made available for download convenience.

I do not use this software anymore, as it supports Ntrip protocol V1 only.

I have developed a Ntrip V2 Caster in C++17 and do sell licenses.

Features

- C++17 codebase for Linux (porting to Windows is possible)
- Ntrip V2 compatible (also supports Ntrip V1)
- Support for NEAREAST style mountpoints selected via client NMEA string
- **Unlimited servers, mountpoints and clients**
- **Single thread high performance code**
- MySQL interface for configuration and logging

License options:

-  450 EUR - Binary delivery for Ubuntu 18.04/Docker, with 1 year bug-fix support
- 1250 EUR - **Source code** delivery (NDA required), with lifetime free updates

I do not provide a frontend (web or native). I can connect you with Customers that have developed their front ends if you are looking for a full ready custom solution.
